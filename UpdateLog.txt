0.1.1 - Changes

- Added colors.py, common use colors, changed local colors, eventually want to be able to customize this within
the application
- Moved all positioning into local for easier access for the time being
- Added Sys image directory for icon images
- Added Sys image loading and dictionary to local
- Added FONT_12 smaller text for hover-help text and small labels
- Modified GUI element interfaces to be more universal + have parent reference to Gui object itself
- Functionality in place to handle tool-tip text functionality
    - Note: I think this is going to require a bit of a change in how the GUI handles itself
- 0.1.1 is being cut a little short, I'm going to be doing a big re-work of the GUI objects to handle events a bit
better which is going to require a lot of things to change slightly so I'm going to go ahead and commit 0.1.1 and
increment up to a new build.

0.1.+ - Planned Changes

- Change button layout and positions, change to icon buttons rather than text
- Add hover-help text to buttons (e.g hover over save it says 'save')
- Enlarge image selection area
- Labels for image areas
- In right preview panel, scale all images to 64x64 when previewing if smaller than 64x64
- Work on text input, transition to using event queue
- Select image scale when saving
- Scale image when adding to compound image
- Layout should be more dynamic to screen size (e.g auto-center itself)
- Implement second state - Menu
- Scroll-ability (mouse and/or scrollbar) for image selection area
- clean up names a bit so we more easily know what they are.
- polish up the code a bit


0.1.0 - Changes

- Removed BUTTON prefixed globals from `local.py` replaced with GUI abbreviated short names
- GuiElement class added as an interface GUI objects should follow
- Removed `callback` option from GuiButton class construct
- Consolidated GUI controls to single array to simplify update/draw calls for GUI elements
- Gui update calls always return, usually None, if not, an action was caught.  Only the last
action will be registered, all others are discarded.
- Text Input button now has focus functionality.  Will need a text input function to make it actually work
- Text input length adjustment
- Not worrying about making text 100% perfect right now, just need it sort of working
- Changed GUI to use dict to store elements and elements need a key to create them.  This is for future use
where we might need to lookup a specific element for one reason or another.
- Image preview working
- Image list working
- Images can now be up to 64x64 but must be square (this may change later)
- GuiImageButton class added to hold image data for a selectable image
- GuiImageButtonGroup added as a manager for GuiImageButton's allowing them to be stored in rows and displayed
within a defined Rect.  Scrolling and Mouse check is handled by this class.
- Fixed display image area to center if not fully filled.

0.1.0 - Bugs/Problems

- fixed in 0.1.0 - Known: Save and Clear not yet implemented, a new Compound image is needed to interact with the GUI classes.
- Text input isn't working too well.  A lot of timing issues and lost keystrokes.  We may need to switch from
using get_pressed() to using the event Queue to log keys.
- Text select (moving the cursor) with the mouse is not implemented.
- Moving the cursor with left-right keys does not work correctly.
- Cursor render is not working as intended when not at the end, this will require the render() method to be
reworked in how it calculates the string length and cursor position relative to the rect
- fixed - Text input does not work if box is empty

0.1.0 - Commit Notes

This build moves everything to a state driven system, so far there is only the build state which is the replacement
for the builder.py and pretty much emulates it's behavior with some additional features such as a module GUI, file
naming, and a few minor differences in the preview stuff.

The next build will aim to implement fixes to the text input (it's a bit rough atm), fixes to the preview (I'd like
the mouse-over to always be scaled to 64x64 regardless of the underlying image), image scaling options (save image
in various sizes) and some other features I've yet to decide on.
