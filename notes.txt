Planned Features:
- allow a user to add images via an interface (no idea how to implement this yet)
- allow a user to flag an image as "excluded"
- allow naming a new images
- selection list of images
- various preview sizes (16x, 32x, 64x)
- move images around
- color images, simple pixel editor?
    - color selection
- rename stock images, e.g load folder with w/e images and rename them
- pixel art editor? like a large scaled 16x16 or 32x32 pixel editor
    - allow editing of existing images


Okay, so I want to figure out the "main" sections I want to make, this will determine how I build the main menu
and general GUI functionality.

On enter, the user should have the option to:
1: Build compound Image - current builder
2: Sprite builder, pixel art kind of tool
3: Sprite Sheet Parser
4: Image Organizer - something to allow organization of images, maybe we should BIN store the images as they're loaded?
